# tic-tac-ai

An AI that plays against you in tic tac toe.
It is written in PyQt5.
There is also an option to enable random inputs in order to see how the AI handles. 
And you can see some numbers as well!
I was thinking about adding a visualization of how the barain thinks. However, I was too lazy. If there are enough requests I might probably make it,
and it's not that difficult to do, anyways.
